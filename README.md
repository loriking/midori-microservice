## :leaves: Midori microservice :leaves:

:rainbow: _The more you know_ :rainbow:

*Midori* is a Japanese word that expresses the color of shoots, young leaves, or whole plants.
Green is often used to symbolize growth, harmony, freshness, fertility and safety.
It is also the most restful color for the human eye.

### Purpose of the microservice
TBD  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### I want to resolve an issue card! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
1. Clone the repo &/or pull last changes of master.
2. Create a new branch with the code of the issue.
3. Create your changes, commit (*mandatory*: put emojis in the message following this https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) and push.
4. Create PR!

### Good practices: (｢• ω •)｢
- Create small PRs: it's easier to review a PR of 3 files than one with more than 20; an issue card can be resolved by several PRs.
- Try to push code formated and optimize the imports.
